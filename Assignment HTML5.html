        <h3>Canvas and SVG tags</h3>
        <p>
            SVG

            Vector based (composed of shapes)
            SVG has better scalability. So it can be printed with high quality at any resolution.
            SVG gives better performance with smaller number of objects or larger surface.
            SVG can be modified through script and CSS.
            Multiple graphical elements, which become the part of the page's DOM tree.

            Canvas
            Raster based (composed of pixel)
            Canvas has poor scalability. Hence it is not suitable for printing on higher resolution.
            Canvas gives better performance with smaller surface or larger number of objects.
            Canvas can be modified through script only.
            Single element similar to <img> in behavior. Canvas diagram can be saved to PNG or JPG format.
