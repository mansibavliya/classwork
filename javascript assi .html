    <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

        JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.
    
    new JScript

    The ECMAScript Edition 5 standard will be the first update to be released in over four years. JavaScript 2.0 conforms to Edition 5 of the ECMAScript standard, and the difference between the two is extremely minor.

    The specification for JavaScript 2.0 can be found on the following site: http://www.ecmascript.org/
    
    Today, Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript conform to the ECMAScript standard, although both the languages still support the features that are not a part of the standard.</p>

    <h3>What is the use of isNaN function?</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, NaN is short for "Not-a-Number". In JavaScript, NaN is a number that is not a legal number. The Number. isNaN() method returns true if the value is NaN , and the type is a Number.</p>

    <h3>What is negative Infinity?</h3>
    <p>The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value which is used to represent a value which is the lowest available. This means that no other number is lesser than this value. It can be generated using a self-made function or by an arithmetic operation.

        Note: JavaScript shows the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity.
        
        Negative infinity is different from mathematical infinity in the following ways:
        
        1) Negative infinity results in 0 when divided by any other number.
        2 ) When divided by itself or positive infinity, negative infinity return NaN
        3 ) Negative infinity, when divided by any positive number (apart from positive infinity) is negative infinity.
        4 ) Negative infinity, divided by any negative number (apart from negative infinity) is positive infinity.
        5 ) If we multiply negative infinity with NaN, we will get NaN as a result.
        6 ) The product of NaN and negative infinity is 0.
        7 ) The product of two negative infinities is always a positive infinity.
        8 ) The product of both positive and negative infinity is always negative infinity.
    </p>

    <h3>Which company developed JavaScript? </h3>
    <p>The Mozilla project provides two JavaScript implementations. The first ever JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape, and has since been updated to conform to ECMA-262 Edition 5 and later versions.</p>

    <h3>What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h3>
    <p>Undefined: It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned with any value. Undefined is not a keyword.

        Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using var or const keyword. If we use 'typeof' operator to get the value of an undeclared variable, we will face the runtime error with return value as “undefined”. The scope of the undeclared variables is always global.</p>

    <h3>Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?</h3>
    <p>HTML documents can be easily accessed and manipulated using HTML DOM , which represents an HTML document as a tree-structure. When an HTML document is loaded in a browser window, it becomes a Document object. With document.createElement() method you can create a specified HTML element dynamically in JavaScript. After creation you can add attributes. If you want the element to show up in your document, you have to insert in into the DOM-tree of the document.</p>

    <h3>What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState? </h3>
    <p>The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage state at the client's end, making state management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state at the server's end, making it easy to manage content from this end too.</p>

    <h3>What is === operator?</h3>
    <p>=== (Triple equals) is a strict equality comparison operator in JavaScript, which returns false for the values which are not of a similar type. This operator performs type casting for equality. If we compare 2 with “2” using ===, then it will return a false value.</p>

    <h3>How can the style/class of an element be changed?</h3>
    <p>Another way to alter the style of an element is by changing its class attribute. class is a reserved word in JavaScript, so in order to access the element's class, you use element. className .</p>

    <h3>How to read and write a file using JavaScript? </h3>
    <p>readFile() and rs. writeFile() methods are used to read and write of a file using javascript. The file is read using the fs. readFile() function, which is an inbuilt method.</p>

    <h3>What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>Different Kinds of Loops
        JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
        
        for - loops through a block of code a number of times
        for/in - loops through the properties of an object
        for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
        while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
        do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
    </p>

    <h3>How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript? </h3>
    <p>In JavaScript parseInt() function (or a method) is used to convert the passed in string parameter or value to an integer value itself. This function returns an integer of base which is specified in second argument of parseInt() function.</p>

    <h3>What is the function of the delete operator? </h3>
    <p>The delete operator removes a given property from an object. On successful deletion, it will return true , else false will be returned.</p>

    <h3>What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript? </h3>
    <p>JavaScript has three kind of popup boxes: Alert box, Confirm box, and Prompt box.
        Alert Box
                An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.
                When an alert box pops up, the user will have to click "OK" to proceed.

        Confirm Box
                A confirm box is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something.
                
                When a confirm box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed.
                
                If the user clicks "OK", the box returns true. If the user clicks "Cancel", the box returns false.

        Prompt Box
                A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page.

                When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed after entering an input value.

                If the user clicks "OK" the box returns the input value. If the user clicks "Cancel" the box returns null.</p>

    <h3>What is the use of Void (0)? </h3>
    <p>JavaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value. You might come across the term “JavaScript:void(0)” while going through HTML documents. It is used to prevent any side effects caused while inserting an expression in a web page.</p>

    <h3>How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript? </h3>
    <p>Approach: We can use window. location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of the document. We can change the URL of a window by accessing it.</p>

    <h3></h3>
    <p>Disadvantages of using innerHTML property in JavaScript:

        1 ) The use of innerHTML very slow: The process of using innerHTML is much slower as its contents as slowly built, also already parsed contents and elements are also re-parsed which takes time.
        2 ) Preserves event handlers attached to any DOM elements: The event handlers do not get attached to the new elements created by setting innerHTML automatically. To do so one has to keep track of the event handlers and attach it to new elements manually. This may cause a memory leak on some browsers.
        3 ) Content is replaced everywhere: Either you add, append, delete or modify contents on a webpage using innerHTML, all contents is replaced, also all the DOM nodes inside that element are reparsed and recreated.
        4 ) Appending to innerHTML is not supported: Usually, += is used for appending in JavaScript. But on appending to an Html tag using innerHTML, the whole tag is re-parsed.
        5 ) Old content replaced issue: The old content is replaced even if object.innerHTML = object.innerHTML + 'html' is used instead of object.innerHTML += 'html'. There is no way of appending without reparsing the whole innerHTML. Therefore, working with innerHTML becomes very slow. String concatenation just does not scale when dynamic DOM elements need to be created as the plus' and quote openings and closings becomes difficult to track.
        6 ) Can break the document: There is no proper validation provided by innerHTML, so any valid HTML code can be used. This may break the document of JavaScript. Even broken HTML can be used, which may lead to unexpected problems.
        7 ) Can also be used for Cross-site Scripting(XSS): The fact that innerHTML can add text and elements to the webpage, can easily be used by malicious users to manipulate and display undesirable or harmful elements within other HTML element tags. Cross-site Scripting may also lead to loss, leak and change of sensitive information.</p>
