            2. Dynamic Website

            1. Static Website: In Static Websites, Web pages are returned by the server which are prebuilt source code files built using simple languages such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. There is no processing of content on the server (according to the user) in Static Websites. Web pages are returned by the server with no change therefore, static Websites are fast. There is no interaction with databases. Also, they are less costly as the host does not need to support server-side processing with different languages.

            2.Dynamic Website: In Dynamic Websites, Web pages are returned by the server which is processed during runtime means they are not prebuilt web pages, but they are built during runtime according to the user's demand with the help of server-side scripting languages such as PHP, Node.js, ASP.NET and many more supported by the server. So, they are slower than static websites but updates and interaction with databases are possible.
